blurb:
  heading: Who are  the Arakanese !
  text: "The Rakhine people or Arakanese people (Burmese: ရခိုင်လူမျိုး, Rakhine
    pronunciation: [ɹəkʰàiɰ̃ lùmjó], Burmese pronunciation: [jəkʰàiɰ̃ lùmjó])
    are a Southeast Asian ethnic group in Myanmar (Burma) forming the majority
    along the coastal region of present-day Rakhine State (formerly officially
    called Arakan). They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total
    population, but no accurate census figures exist. Rakhine people also live
    in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong Division
    and Barisal Division. A group of Rakhine descendants, living in the
    Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are
    known as the Marma people or Mog people."

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
